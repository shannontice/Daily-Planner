# Daily-Planner
## Description
In this project we were given some code to expand on in order to create a daily planner. The planner shows an accurate date and time time blocks for each houe within a standard work day 9am-5pm. Within the hour time blocks the user can enter events or information to help plan out their day and save that information to the browser for future review.
